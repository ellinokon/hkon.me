The purpose of this websites existence is to document what I learn and do:
Development and technology related struggles, musical endeavours, and other
interesting tidbits. I expect some of it might be of interest to people other
than me.

This site is primarily driven by [Metalsmith](//www.metalsmith.io/), which is a
static site generator. An article detailing how it's setup might be a possible
next addition to this site.

On a related note; [this websites source code](//github.com/ellinokon/hkon.me)
should be available on Github.
