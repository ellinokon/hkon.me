Setting goals for yourself is an useless endeavour if you don't follow up on
them. Quarterly reviews appear like a fine balance between being heads down,
and actually paying attention to where you are going.

## First Quarterly review

### Rehabilitate lower body (200 gym sessions)

I'm up to 28 sessions at the gym this year. Combined with home mobility sessions
this puts me at both within my goal, and hopelessly far behind. Depending on how
strictly you want to view the goal.

A slow ramp is preferable to going too hard and making things worse. At this
rate I'll be back to my usual self in no time.

### Earn a living being a "solotrepeneur"

On track and sustainable. Could either look into diversifying and making a
greater and more secure income, or keeping things as they are while I do other
things.

This goal is eating into time I could use for my other goals, but not in an
unpleasant manner. Really enjoying the work I'm doing so far.

### Write 50 posts this year

At 6 posts total this year I'm not sitting pretty on this one. In order to end
up somewhat close to my goal by the end of the year I'll need to revise my
strategy.

200 words a day is one strategy people seem to be effective with. This will just
have to be one of the main three things on my prioritised todo list for each day.

### Read 25 books

I'm up one finished business book and a few fiction pieces I started in 2018.
Again I'm not doing too well, even if you count audiobooks. Starting a book is
easier than finishing it. Especially when you have a habit of ordering too many
interesting ones.

This goal will probably have to wait a bit while I work on the others.

### Finish ~~6~~ 3 projects

This one has already been revised in order to fit more with time spent doing
paid work. Training your shipping muscle also works when you are shipping
to clients.

I'm thinking of skipping my previous idea of a todo list/calendar merged product
and instead focusing more on spaced repetition learning, and what could be done
in that space. Calendars are just way too much of a pain for a solo developer to
be working on alone.

## Books

**Hatching Twitter: A True Story of Money, Power, Friendship, and Betrayal**\
After listening to _Bad Blood: Secrets and Lies in a Silicon Valley Startup_ I
have been craving another true crime audiobook. While _Hatching Twitter_ isn't
about any crime, it is still a story about a Silicon Valley company in turmoil.
Close enough to get me interested!

As of now I am halfway through the story and loving every minute of it. While
the story is light on technical details, it is full of nicely portrayed drama
and infighting. It's also narrated in such a way where I can listen to it at
the gym and not get distracted.

## Links

[**Chasing 10X: Leveraging A Poor Memory In Engineering**](https://senrigan.io/blog/chasing-10x-leveraging-a-poor-memory-in-software-engineering)\
Interesting take on how you can become more productive with just a little bit of
effort. Definitely something I'm looking to implement myself.

[**Sophisticated Partitioning with CSS Grid**](https://v6.robweychert.com/blog/2019/03/css-grid-sophisticated-partitioning/)\
CSS Grid is a really excellent feature. It has made implementing designs on the
web easier than it used to be, while also allowing for detailed expression.

Rob Weychert has taken CSS Grid a bit further in his quite thorough writeup.
