Doing these weeknotes appears like the best way to get my writing habit properly
kickstarted. Done in an informal style, the barriers to entry will be severely
lowered. No more lack of "valuable content" and other excuses in the same vein!

The final format of these posts is yet to be decided, but to kick things off
I'm going to ramble about some books that have gotten me quite hyped recently.

## Books

Since my last update I have both started and finished reading the excellent
[_It Doesn't Have to Be Crazy at Work_](https://basecamp.com/books/calm), by
Jason Fried and David Heinemeier Hansson. After having greatly enjoyed their
previous work, _Rework_, I rightfully assumed that this too would be a treat.
Finishing the book in just one and a half sitting speaks volumes for the
quality, I my humble opinion.

The Basecamp founders message of calm and balanced work is supported by their
essay style of writing. No fluff, just the message shoot straight across the
table. If you are looking for "hustle porn" this isn' it. What we get instead
is plenty of wise nuggets from people who can walk the walk.

The next book I am working on is [_Company of One_](https://ofone.co/). 1/4th
ways through the book it's already looking like a winner. After being subscribed
to Paul Jarvis' newsletter for a few years that comes as no suprise.

What did come as a surprise was the book _Bad Blood: Secrets and Lies in a
Silicon Valley Startup_. I listened to it as an audiobook, and boy is it a
riveting tale! One of the better true crime stories I have encountered in years.
Highly recommended!
