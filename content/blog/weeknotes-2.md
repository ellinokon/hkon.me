The first weekend of march, and some hours/days leading up to it, was spent
helping host a local LAN party. Being part of the "gaming crew" my job consisted
of setting up and managing esport competitions for the LAN attendants. Covering
a wide variety of games and events, we hopefully had a lot of happy participants
by the end.

A weekend quite out of the ordinary, but well spent nonetheless.

## Maker projects

I had to lay aside my side project for a while when I was lucky enough to
acquire actual paid work. Not because there haven't been time available to work
on my own projects, but because mental capacity is a thing. Sometimes when you
rent out your brain for small visits at a time, the visitors end up overstaying.

Plan forward is to get going on a fun todo list and time planning crossover
utility. Creative and unique idea? Yeah, I know. Thing is, I have yet to find a
simple tool that allows me to track what tasks I need to work on while easily
allowing me to pre-plan my workdays.

Focused work is a prerequisite for deep work. No tool that I currently know of
allows me to easily manage this part of my workday. If I only solve a problem
that I have, I'll still be happy with the project.

More info to come.

## Books

**On the Shortness of Life**\
I recently got a few books in the mail. Thinking this was a quick read since
it's short and small, I put it at the top of my reading queue. Reality quickly
hit me with a sledgehammer as I tried to plow through the first chapter.

Lucius Annaeus Seneca strings his words along like no other writer I have
encountered before, making it hard to get into a flow while reading. This also
makes it difficult as a non-native reader of English to get to the essence of each
chapter.

The book has already revealed some magic to me, and I am determined to get
through it properly.

[**Starting & Sustaining**](https://startingandsustaining.com/)\
A lucky find while procrastinating reading through "business blogs". The first
few chapters got me sucked in as the writing itself is quite solid. Hopefully
the book will be a worthwhile use of time in the end.
